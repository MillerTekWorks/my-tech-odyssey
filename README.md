## 1.0 Mission Statement & Objective

This document outlines my self-directed, structured transition into the field of AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics. It serves as my personal roadmap and a public commitment to the systematic execution of a rigorous learning and development plan.

My primary objective is to become **job-ready by building a compelling portfolio of 3-5 significant projects** that demonstrate practical, in-demand skills. For a long time, I've been inspired by the potential of these fields, from autonomous systems to near-future humanoid robot assistants. Now is the time to convert that passion into a tangible skill set and a new career.

## 2.0 Project Roadmap & Deliverables

The plan is broken into sequential phases, each with a clear focus and a key project deliverable. Progress is tracked using the [Issues](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/ai-robotics-career-plan/issues) and [Project Board](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/ai-robotics-career-plan/projects) for this repository.

### Phase 1: Foundational Skills Acquisition (Target: Q3-Q4 2025)
This phase is dedicated to building deep fluency in the required fundamentals.

**Workstream 1: Programming & Core Tools**
> **Action:** Master Python fundamentals and progress to its application in engineering and data science (NumPy, Pandas). Semi-concurrently, build a foundational understanding of C++ for performance-critical systems and gain fluency in Git/GitHub.

**Workstream 2: Mathematics for Machine Learning**
> **Action:** Systematically fill in knowledge gaps in Algebra and Trigonometry to enable a deep study of Linear Algebra, Differential Calculus, and Statistics.

**Key Deliverable for Phase 1:**
* **Project 1: The Sensor Data Analyst.** A project demonstrating mastery of data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Python and real-world sensor data.
    * **Repository:** [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/sensor-data-analyst) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

### Phase 2: Specialization in Intelligent Systems (Target: Q1-Q2 2026)
This phase involves applying the foundational skills to build the core components of an intelligent agent.

**Workstream 1: Machine Learning & Perception**
> **Action:** Master the fundamental principles of ML and Deep Learning, focusing on Computer Vision (CV) with PyTorch.

**Workstream 2: Robotics & Simulation**
> **Action:** Learn the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Gazebo simulator to understand how robotic components communicate and operate in a virtual environment.

**Key Deliverables for Phase 2:**
* **Project 2: The "Robot's Eye" Perception System.** A computer vision model trained to identify and locate objects.
    * **Repository:** [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/robot-eye-perception-system) *(Link will be active once project is created)*
* **Project 3A: The Simulated Home Bot.** Integration of the perception system with a simulated mobile robot that can navigate its environment in Gazebo.
    * **Repository:** [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/simulated-home-bot) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

### Phase 3: Physical Implementation & Capstone (Target: Q3-Q4 2026)
This final phase bridges the gap from simulation to the real world.

**Workstream: Hardware-Software Integration**
> **Action:** Learn to work with embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Arduino) and port the software from the simulation onto a physical robotic platform.

**Key Deliverable for Phase 3:**
* **Project 3B: The Physical Prototype.** A tangible, working robot that successfully executes a task using the software developed in the previous phases.
     * **Repository:** [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/physical-robot-prototype) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

## 3.0 Methodology

My approach to executing this plan is guided by the following principles:

* **Project-Based Learning:** All theoretical knowledge will be immediately applied to the projects outlined above. Skills are only truly learned when they are used and put into repetitive practice to actually build something.
* **Open Documentation:** This blog and my GitHub repositories will serve as a transparent log of my work. Documenting my process, including challenges and solutions, and failures, is a critical part of the engineering discipline.
* **Consistent Execution:** I have committed to a schedule of 20-40 hours per week to ensure steady, measurable progress through the roadmap.

## 4.0 Next Steps

My immediate focus is on the workstreams of Phase 1. I am currently deep in Python fundamentals and my mathematics refresher curriculum.

I am always open to networking with and learning from developers, engineers, and mentors in the relevant fields. Thank you for reading my initial plan; I invite you to follow along as I turn it into a reality. [The best way to connect is via my LinkedIn Profile.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-seanmiller/)
