## 1.0 Mission Statement & Objective

This document outlines my self-directed, structured transition into the field of AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics. It serves as my **personal roadmap and a public commitment** to the systematic execution of a rigorous learning and development plan.

My **primary objective** is to become **job-ready by building a compelling portfolio of 3-5 significant projects** that demonstrate practical, in-demand skills. 

> _For a long time, I've been inspired by the potential of these fields, from autonomous systems to near-future humanoid robot assistants. Now is the time to convert that passion into a tangible skill set and a new career._

## 2.0 Project Roadmap & Deliverables

The roadmap is divided into three major **phases**, each with specific focus areas, a primary objective, and key deliverables. Progress is tracked using [Issues](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/my-tech-odyssey/issues) and a [Project Board](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/my-tech-odyssey/projects).

### Phase 1: Foundational Skills Acquisition (Target: Q4 2025)
This phase is dedicated to building deep fluency in the required fundamentals.  
🧠 **Focus:** Python, Git, Math, C++, Data Analysis

**Workstream 1: Programming & Core Tools**
> **Action:** Master Python fundamentals and progress to its application in engineering and data science (NumPy, Pandas). Semi-concurrently, build a foundational understanding of C++ for performance-critical systems and gain fluency in Git/GitHub.

**Workstream 2: Mathematics for Machine Learning**
> **Action:** Systematically fill in knowledge gaps and strengthen my core in Algebra and Trigonometry to enable a deeper study of Linear Algebra, Differential Calculus, and Statistics.

**📦 Key Deliverable for Phase 1:**
* **Project 1: The Sensor Data Analyst.** A project demonstrating mastery of data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using Python and real-world sensor data.
    * **Repository:** 🔗 [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/sensor-data-analyst) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

### 🤖 Phase 2: Specialization in Intelligent Systems (Target: Q2 2026)
This phase involves applying the foundational skills to build the core components of an intelligent agent.  
🔍 **Focus:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Simulation 

**Workstream 1: Machine Learning & Perception**
> **Action:** Master the fundamental principles of ML and Deep Learning, focusing on Computer Vision (CV) with PyTorch.

**Workstream 2: Robotics & Simulation**
> **Action:** Learn the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Gazebo simulator to understand how robotic components communicate and operate in a virtual environment.

**📦 Key Deliverables for Phase 2:**
* **Project 2: The "Robot's Eye" Perception System.** A CV model trained to identify and locate objects.
    * **Repository:** 🔗 [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/robot-eye-perception-system) *(Link will be active once project is created)*
* **Project 3A: The Simulated Home Bot.** Integration of the perception system with a simulated mobile robot that can navigate its environment in Gazebo.
    * **Repository:** 🔗 [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/simulated-home-bot) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

### 🛠️ Phase 3: Physical Implementation & Capstone (Target: Q4 2026)
This final phase bridges the gap from simulation to the real world.  
🤝 **Focus:** Hardware Integration, Embedded Systems, Physical Robotics

**Workstream: Hardware-Software Integration**
> **Action:** Learn to work with embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Arduino) and port the software from the simulation onto a physical robotic platform.

**📦 Key Deliverable for Phase 3:**
* **Project Codsworth (3B): The Physical Prototype.** A tangible, real-world robot that executes defined tasks using the integrated hardware and software from prior phases.  
     * **Repository:** 🔗 [Go to Project &raquo;](https://github.com/MillerTekWorks/physical-robot-prototype) *(Link will be active once project is created)*

## 3.0 Methodology

My approach to executing this plan is built around core engineering values and guided by the following principles:

* ✅ **Project-Based Learning:** All theoretical knowledge will be applied to the projects outlined above. Skills are only truly learned when they are used and put into repetitive practice to actually build something through immediate application in the form of building real-world systems.
* 📓 **Open Documentation:** My future blog and this repo and linked spokes serve as a transparent engineering log of my process—including challenges, design decisions, and lessons learned. It's a critical part of the engineering discipline.
* ⏱ **Consistent Execution:** I have committed to a schedule of **20-40 hours** per week to ensure steady, measurable, and continuous progress and mastery through the roadmap.

## 4.0 Next Steps

My immediate focus is on the workstreams of Phase 1. I am currently deep in Python fundamentals and my mathematics refresher curriculum.

I am always open to networking with and learning from developers, engineers, and mentors in the relevant fields. Thank you for reading my initial plan; I invite you to follow along as I turn it into a reality. [The best way to connect is via my LinkedIn Profile.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-seanmiller/)
